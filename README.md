# Rectangle

### Project Structure

1. **First function: Check if the triangle can exist**
   - Takes the three side lengths of a triangle as input.
   - Checks if a triangle can exist with these sides (the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side).

2. **Second function: Check if the triangle is isosceles**
   - Takes the three side lengths of a triangle as input.
   - Determines if the triangle is isosceles (two sides must be equal).

3. **Third function: Check if the triangle is equilateral**
   - Takes the three side lengths of a triangle as input.
   - Checks if the triangle is equilateral (all three sides are equal).

4. **Fourth function: Check if the triangle is right-angled**
   - Takes the three side lengths of a triangle as input.
   - Determines if the triangle is right-angled (using the Pythagorean theorem: the square of the longest side must be equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides).
